/*
Want to create a Fullstack portfolio site using React and Sanity
- Create a new repo on Github, and clone
- Install React on local repo, and push the changes to Github
- Deploy on Netlify via Github, and create access token to ensure automatic deployment using a push.yml file
- Create a folder in the root directory for the backend part. Install sanity on this directory
- After the installation, look inside the backend folder for the schema folder, and then index.js. Create another file, eg. testimonials.js. Then create the schemas and export/import them according to the info in the docs: https://www.sanity.io/docs/create-a-schema-and-configure-sanity-studio
- Do npm run dev (if I choose manual installation of dependencies, then this will be sanity start), and the schema title should appear on the left side of the screen
- Continue to add new schemas, which will continue to populate them on the LHS of the UI in Sanity
- src folder - index.js, App.js, index.css
- npm install @sanity-cli @sanity/image-url framer-motion node-sass react-icons
- Create components, assets and container folders with requisite files and components. 
- Import into App.js
- Create App.scss within src folder
