/*
Want to create a Fullstack portfolio site using React and Sanity
- Create a new repo on Github, and clone
- Install React on local repo, and push the changes to Github
- Deploy on Netlify via Github, and create access token to ensure automatic deployment using a push.yml file
- Create a folder in the root directory for the backend part. Install sanity on this directory
- After the installation, look inside the backend folder for the schema folder, and then index.js. Create another file, eg. testimonials.js
